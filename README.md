# Connect-Four-For-Glass-OpenCV-Computer-Vision
Connect Four Game using OpenCv On Google Glass

It was the final project for my Master Degree in Computer Science at Universit√† degli Studi di Perugia, in 2015.

This project is a glassware for Google Glass device.
It lets the person who is wearing the device to play at Connect Four game (in the real life, on a real table) even if he/she does not know the rules.
(yes it's a very unuseful use, but it's just a kind of approach to augmented reality on Google Glass)

The glassware uses image recognition tecniques through the OpenCV library to analyze the input frames of the grid.
When the recognition of all the elements is done (in particular the grid and the position of the two players buttons on the grid), an algorithm is used to decide the best move to suggest to the player.

The result is showed to the player into the Google Glass screen in front of the player's eye, as you can see in this video demonstration:
